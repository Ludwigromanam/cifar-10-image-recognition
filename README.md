# cifar-10-image-recognition
Trying to build a classifier for 10.000 images from the cifar-10000 dataset

To execute the classifier and see results, just run `mlp.py` from the `src` folder. To change the image encoder it uses, just import a different one at the first line of `mlp.py`

You can see all results at [results.md](https://github.com/daniellima/cifar-10-image-recognition/blob/master/results.md)
